## Introduction
This lesson is about data preprocessing. Data is a collection of facts and figures, observations, or descriptions of things in an unorganized or organized form. In cases of Particle Physics, we only have numerical or categorical data, but we might need different representations, for example, Jet Image. <br>
Data preprocessing is a very important first step for anyone dealing with data sets. Thatâ€™s because it leads to better data sets, that are cleaner and are more manageable.<br><br>
There are 5 data samples in the data folder. They are different in data types but same in content. Shape = (20k, 79)

## Outline
Considering the limited time, we split this session into two parts: Common Skills and Advanded Skills. The formmer is required, and I highly recommend you to complete the Advanded Data Preprocessing, if you would like to study further in Particle Physics.

Common Skills:
1. Load & Save various data types.
2. Learning features
3. Jet Image Plotting.
4. Train test split.

Advanced Skills:
1. Downsizing data with a specific ratio.
2. N-constituents of Jets.
3. Jet Clustering & Rotating.
